I am a first-year Computer Science major at CSUF, and I plan to graduate in 2029.

## Favorite labs

* Lab 7:

    This is one of my favorite labs of the semester because it made me realize that there is more to vectors than I initially thought. At first, I believed it could only hold values with primitive data types, then this lab and the lecture that preceded it made me realize a vector can also contain another vector, otherwise known as a 2D vector. Such a revelation possessed somewhat of a “wow” factor to it, as it made me learn something that I never thought about. 

* Lab 8, Part 2: 

    I liked this lab because it allowed me to sharpen my knowledge of nested loops. This was done through the use of implementing one for loop within another for loop. I liked that it challenged me to think critically, because I was struggling to figure out how to write each of the loop headers, and when I figured it out it was satisfying to see it functioning properly.

* Lab 10: 

    I liked this lab a lot because it made me experiment a lot with vectors and for each loops. It also made me utilize the string-to-integer function (stoi) and string-to-double function (stod). I would also use the stod function to perform arithmetic operations like division. This lab also felt fairly easy for me, and I was able to get it done smoothly without many issues.
